            designed for creative work. It should be easy to navigate, look stunning on all devices and be optimized for
            maximum image quality.

            French artistic director and designer Elise Eskanazi uses the homepage of her online portfolio to display a
            quick overview of her projects. Each project can then be viewed full-size in the Ora theme’s vertical
            scroll.</P>

        <P class="paraa">
            Dublin based Studio Sans have a very simple approach to their design portfolio. The less is more approach
            allows them to beautifully showcase some of the best projects without overloading their potential clients
            with too much. Using the Spruce theme they showcase their work in a clean grid that utilizes their dominant
            colors as borders of their portfolio images, a feature which is built into the Spruce theme.</P>
